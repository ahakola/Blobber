# Blobber

Small addon to announce (yell and raid chat) which Globule to kill on Yor'sahj the Unsleeping hardmode. Doesn't have/support ingame config, normal-mode or LFR-mode.

New in 1.2: Ingame option to enable/disable announcing so more than one person can have this addon loaded in the raid without things getting spammy.
- Setting is global (same for all characters) and is set to `true` on first login after upgrading/installing this addon.
-Slash commands `/blob` and `/blobber` both work. If no attributes is given, addon will print out the current state of announcing.
- `/blob(er)` `enable`, `toggle, `true` and `default` will enable announcing.
- `/blob(er)` `disable` and `false` will disable announcing.
- Unknown attribute will print small help of the commands.
- You should be able to change the setting even in middle of the fight to enable or disable announcing.
- Mem usage still ~9kb.
